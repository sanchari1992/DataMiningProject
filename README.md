# Data Mining Project
## A Comparison of Various Forecasting Models in Predicting Indian Rainfall from Spatio-temporal Data
### Author: Sanchari Biswas

##### 1 Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze a number of prediction models (KNN, SVM, Prophet, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, LightGBM, XGBoost) on the amount of rainfall in major Indian cities from the spatio-temporal data in the Kaggle dataset [Indian Weather and Astronomy Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitwanmanchanda/weather-api-data) collected from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

##### 2 Significance

India is a country ranking second in the terms of population worldwide. But draughts leading to famines have been rampant in the country, the most of them being hydrological. In history, these draughts have led to the most disastrous circumstances, like the Bengal famine of 1770, in which about one third of the population of the entire state of Bengal perished. Not only then, in recent times as well, the draught of 2013 in the state of Maharashtra affected 25 million people.
My project will aim to build prediction models as mentioned above from the spatio-temporal weather data and, in the process, aim to find the most accurate rainfall prediction model. This model can then be used to forecast upcoming rainfall shortage periods and thus lead to proper agricultural planning thus lessening the ferociousness of hydrological draughts.
